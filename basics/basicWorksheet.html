<!-- l. 22 --><p class="noindent">Broadly speaking, <strong>integrable probability</strong> is a branch of probability theory which
studies models which have exact solutions. For this reason, these models are often
called <strong>exactly solvable.</strong> From these exact solutions, one can derive precise
<strong>universal</strong> asymptotics, such as the famed Tracy–Widom distribution. The origin of
these solutions are usually due to algebraic symmetries underlying the model. In
these set of lecture notes, we will introduce the relevant algebraic background with a
probabilistic researcher as the target audience.
</p><!-- l. 29 --><p class="noindent">For historical context, the terminology originates in integrable systems from
Hamiltonian mechanics. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the phase space is represented as
a smooth manifold with even dimension \(2n,\) with coordinates denoted \(q_1,\ldots ,q_n,p_1,\ldots ,p_n\) for the
momentumm and position. An integrable system is a system with \(n\) conserved
quantities, and then Liouville–Arnold theorem states that the equations of
motioni can be solved in quadratures. For an explicit example, the harmonic
oscillator in one dimension (imagine an object attached to a frictionless spring)
is integrable, and the conserved quantity is the total energy. In contrast,
the three–body problem is not integrable, and its solutions are notoriously
non–exact.
</p><!-- l. 38 --><p class="noindent">During the 1980s, many Soviet mathematicians and physicsts introduced quantum
mechanics into integrable systems. In quantum mechanics, quantities such as position,
momentum and energy became operators which generally do not commute;
additionally, the values of these quantities only take discrete, “quantized” values. In
this context, the concept of “conserved quantities” becomes “commuting operators,”
and values of the quantities are eigenvalues of eigenstates. At the time, their
approaches were called the “quantum inverse scattering method.” Since then, the
method has been generalized to abstract algebraic objects, such as Hopf
algebras.
</p><!-- l. 46 --><p class="noindent">These notes will introduce one such algebraic object, known as <strong>quantum groups,</strong>
with a particular focus on the Yang–Baxter equation. The exposition will use
probability and mathematical physics as a motivation. The goal is for a reader with a
probability background to be able to read contemporary (as of 2024) research papers
in integrable probability.

<!-- l. 55 --><p class="noindent">To begin to motivate the notes, we first introduce the asymmetric simple exclusion
process (ASEP) and its relationship to the Heisenberg XXZ model and the quantum
group \(U_q(sl_2).\)
